"""
The eval() expression is a very powerful built-in function of Python. 
It helps in evaluating an expression. 
The expression can be a Python statement, or a code object. 
eval() can also be used to work with Python keywords or defined functions and variables. 
These would normally be stored as strings.

Task
You are given an expression in a line. Read that line as a string variable, such as var, and print the result using eval(var). 
Sample Input

print(2 + 3)
