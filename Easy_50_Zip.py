"""
The National University conducts an examination of N students in X subjects.
Your task is to compute the average scores of each student.

The first line contains N and X separated by a space.
The next X lines contains the space separated marks obtained by students in a particular subject. 

Pythonâ€™s zip() function creates an iterator that will aggregate elements from two or more iterables. 
You can use the resulting iterator to quickly and consistently solve common programming problems, like creating dictionaries.
